# Setup

There doesn't seem to be any official documentation for controllers on the original homepage. Make sure to check out [the examples](https://github.com/Lusito/box2d.ts/tree/master/apps/testbed/src/tests/controllers) instead.

We aim to stay true to the original API where we can, but sometimes it's not possible. We'll cover the differences in upcoming tutorials.

## Install With NPM

```bash
npm i @box2d/controllers
```

This library extends [@box2d/core](../../core/README.md), so make sure to check that out as well.
