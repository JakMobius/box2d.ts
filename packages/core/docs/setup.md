# Setup

This is a TypeScript port of [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D) by Erin Catto, which means that for the most part you can use the documentation found at [the official homepage](https://box2d.org/documentation/). If you need examples, you can find them [on GitHub](https://github.com/Lusito/box2d.ts/tree/master/apps/testbed/src/tests/core).

We aim to stay true to the original API where we can, but sometimes it's not possible. We'll cover the differences in the following tutorials.

## Install With NPM

```bash
npm i @box2d/core
```

## TypeScript vs JavaScript

A note on the documentation on this page:

All examples are shown in TypeScript, but you can use @box2d with JavaScript as well. Just remove the type information from the examples and you are good to go.
