# Setup

@box2d/debug-draw is a TypeScript port of Erin Cattos debug drawing helper for [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d).
This is a fork of [box2d.ts](https://github.com/flyover/box2d.ts) from Isaac Burns (flyover) who did a huge job initially porting Box2D and [LiquidFun](https://github.com/google/liquidfun) to TypeScript.

## Install With NPM

```bash
npm i @box2d/debug-draw
```

This library extends [@box2d/core](../../core/README.md), so make sure to check that out as well.
