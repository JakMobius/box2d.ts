# Controllers

This is a TypeScript port of the controllers code found in [LiquidFun](https://github.com/google/liquidfun) by Google. There doesn't seem to be any official documentation for controllers on the original homepage. Make sure to check out [the examples](https://github.com/Lusito/box2d.ts/tree/master/packages/testbed/src/tests/controllers) instead.

We try to stay true to the original API where we can, but sometimes it's not possible. We'll cover the differences in upcoming tutorials.

Make sure to check out the [Setup](../README.md) guide first!
