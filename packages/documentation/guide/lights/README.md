# Lights

This is a TypeScript port of [Box2D Lights](https://github.com/libgdx/box2dlights) from LibGDX.

Even though it is part of the `@box2d` ecosystem, you can actually use this one with other physics libraries as well.

We try to stay true to the original API where we can, but sometimes it's not possible. We'll cover the differences in the following tutorials.

Make sure to check out the [Setup](../README.md) guide first!
