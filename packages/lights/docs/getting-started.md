# Getting Started

## Preparations

Since the `@box2d/lights` package is written without a dependency to `@box2d/core` (so it can be used by other physics librares), you'll need to create some glue code. I've preparaed a sample implementation on [GitHub](https://github.com/Lusito/box2d.ts/blob/master/packages/testbed/src/utils/lights/RayHandlerImpl.ts). Feel free to just copy/paste that into your code-base.

## Setup

In your setup code, write:

```ts
const rayHandler = new RayHandlerImpl(world, glContext, camera.width / 4, camera.height / 4, viewport.x, viewport.y);
```

## Enable/Disable Shadows

You can disable shadows with:

```ts
rayHandler.setShadows(false);
```

## Creating Lights

### Ambient Light

You can set the ambient light with

```ts
rayHandler.setAmbientLight(r, g, b, a);
rayHandler.setBlurNum(3);
```

### Point Lights

This creates a new white point light. RAY_NUM being the number of ray lights (e.g.: 4 is a simple star)

```ts
const light = new PointLight(rayHandler, RAYS_NUM, new LightColor(1, 1, 1, 1), lightDistance, x, y);
```

## Rendering

In your render loop after everything is drawn that you want to be lit:

```ts
rayHandler.setCombinedMatrix(camera.combined, center.x, center.y, camera.width, camera.height);
rayHandler.updateAndRender();
```

## Cleanup

Remember to dispose the ray handler (and lights, etc.) when cleaning up:

```ts
rayHandler.dispose();
```
