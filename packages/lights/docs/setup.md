# Lights

This is a TypeScript port of [Box2D Lights](https://github.com/libgdx/box2dlights) from LibGDX.

Even though it is part of the `@box2d` ecosystem, you can actually use this one with other physics libraries as well.

We aim to stay true to the original API where we can, but sometimes it's not possible. We'll cover the differences in the following tutorials.

## Install With NPM

```bash
npm i @box2d/lights
```

This library is theoretically physics-engine agnostic, so you should be able to use it with whatever 2D physics library you are using. It was mainly designed to work well with [@box2d/core](../../core/README.md), so make sure to check that out as well.
