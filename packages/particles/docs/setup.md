# Particles

This is a TypeScript port of the particles code found in [LiquidFun](https://github.com/google/liquidfun) by Google. For now, you'll have to read [the official documentation](http://google.github.io/liquidfun/) and adjust it to the TypeScript version. Make sure to check out [the examples](https://github.com/Lusito/box2d.ts/tree/master/apps/testbed/src/tests/particles) as well.

We aim to stay true to the original API where we can, but sometimes it's not possible. We'll cover the differences in upcoming tutorials.

## Install With NPM

```bash
npm i @box2d/particles
```

This library extends [@box2d/core](../../core/README.md), so make sure to check that out as well.
